## Summury

I started *front-end development* education in 2017.
At first, I was fond of graphic design and Photoshop, however, after reading Artemy Lebedev's book "Covodstvo", I became familar with the concepts of web0development and web-design.
At that time, for me, the differences in proffessions seemed imperceptible.
I like the idea itself and the ability to make web more beautiful and more convinient.
And I began my learning path.

At first, I opened [htmlbook](http://htmlbook.ru/) and rewrote all the tags into paper notebook and just memorized them, but absolutely didn't know what to do with them.
After that I came across [webref](https://webref.ru/) resource - it gave me basic concepts about web in general.
At the same time I watched video tutorials on YouTube and was very inspired by Daniil Fimushkin (web-designer from Russia).
Web-development then seemed like an easy and exiting journey and at that time I hadn't heard of such sing as a *front-end*.
I just studied what I like and followed the dream of making web more beautiful and more convinient from usability perspective.

But once, my good friend told me about recruiting for *Front-end Development Training* at ***EPAM***.
I had all the chances to get there, except for knowlwdge of **JavaScript**, and I started to learn it in two month before the training started.
Here I felt what is really *web-development*.
Fortunately, I found the famous resourse for beginers [learnjavascript](https://learn.javascript.ru/). Since I need to visualize the information, I began to learn using the same approach as I used before learning *HTML/CSS* - I took a notebook and wrote the code by hand and memorized the syntax.

The basic knowleges of *algorithms and OOP* was also indicated in the requirements, but I didn't have time to study these topics before the start of the course and I decided that it was better to direct my efforts to learning the language.
