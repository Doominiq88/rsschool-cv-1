## Summary

I started *front-end development* education in 2017.
At first, I was fond of graphic design and Photoshop, however, after reading Artemy Lebedev's book "Covodstvo", I became familar with the concepts of web0development and web-design.
At that time, for me, the differences in proffessions seemed imperceptible.
I like the idea itself and the ability to make web more beautiful and more convinient.
And I began my learning path.

At first, I opened [htmlbook](http://htmlbook.ru/) and rewrote all the tags into paper notebook and just memorized them, but absolutely didn't know what to do with them.
After that I came across [webref](https://webref.ru/) resource - it gave me basic concepts about web in general.
At the same time I watched video tutorials on YouTube and was very inspired by Daniil Fimushkin (web-designer from Russia).
Web-development then seemed like an easy and exiting journey and at that time I hadn't heard of such sing as a *front-end*.
I just studied what I like and followed the dream of making web more beautiful and more convinient from usability perspective.

But once, my good friend told me about recruiting for *"Front-end Development Training"* at ***EPAM***.
I had all the chances to get there, except for knowlwdge of *JavaScript*, and I started to learn it in two month before the training started.
Here I felt what is really *web-development*.
Fortunately, I found the famous resourse for beginers [learnjavascript](https://learn.javascript.ru/). Since I need to visualize the information, I began to learn using the same approach as I used before learning *HTML/CSS* - I took a notebook and wrote the code by hand and memorized the syntax.

The basic knowleges of *algorithms and OOP* was also indicated in the requirements, but I didn't have time to study these topics before the start of the course and I decided that it was better to direct my efforts to learning the language. But lack of basic knowlege of *algorithms and OOP* played a trick with me in scope of the training unfotunately.
I got into training at ***EPAM*** and I had to study a huge amount of related topics and concepts that I had to know before enrolling to the training. 
To my regret, my knowlege at the end of the course was not enough for the posotion *front-end developer*.

At some point, something happened to me called imposter syndrome.
I wanted to give up everything and forget about the career of a programmer, but in July 2019, I found out about recruiting in ***RSSchool*** - for me it was like light in the dark, I again felt a desire to develop and realized that this was a great chance to close my knowledge gaps and structure it in my head. 
Also, my plan is to enroll to ***DesignSpot School*** as Iâ€™m fond of *UI/UX design* to wide skillset in scope of *front-end development*.

## English

I studied English only at school. Until the 6th grade, I studied English at a linguistics gymnasium in Vitebsk in a class with a focus on English.
In July 2019, I graduated from English courses with native speakers from America - ***Practically Speaking English by [ESL.by](http://esl.by/)***.
In this course I determined the level of language - *Intermediate*.
The courses lasted 9 days, 2 hours per day.
